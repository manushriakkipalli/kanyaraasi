# Project Title: HELIOSKIN HUB - 'The Sun-Stainable Living Shell'

## 1. What Your Project Does

This project, developed by Team Kanyaraasi01 for SIH 2025, is the complete Building Information Modeling (BIM) design of a **4-story commercial office building**, named the HELIOSKIN HUB. The design features a unique, **9-shape sloping form** and is characterized by a **Kinetic Solar Facade**, which controls solar glare and contributes to sustainability. The core deliverable is a **clash-free coordinated BIM Digital Twin** created by ensuring seamless integration between separate Revit Architecture and Revit Structure models.

## 2. Problem Statement & Solution

### Problem Statement
Students are tasked with designing a 4-story commercial office building using Revit Architecture and Revit Structure, ensuring effective integration between architectural and structural models in a BIM environment. (The size of the plot can be assumed by the students, all the dimensions wherever necessary can be assumed by students in mm units).

### Solution: Clash-Free, Climate-Responsive BIM Model
The solution, HELIOSKIN HUB, addresses the core problem by delivering a single, coordinated, and **zero-clash** BIM model. The design is context-responsive and focuses on sustainability, which is achieved through:
* **Zero Clashes:** BIM was used proactively to prevent all construction conflicts up front.
* **Mitigation of Solar Glare and Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect**.
* **Reduced energy use** via high-performance materials (GFRC, Insulated Glass) and the dynamic façade.

## 3. Features

* **BIM Digital Twin:** Clash-free, coordinated models from Revit Architecture and Revit Structure.
* **Kinetic Solar Facade:** A solar-powered, auto-adaptive tensile fabric façade that actively controls solar glare.
* **Context Responsive Design:** Incorporates a central courtyard, green roof, and optimized orientation based on site analysis in DLF Downtown, Gurgaon.
* **High Performance:** Utilization of sustainable, high-performance materials like GFRC and Insulated Glass.
* **Advanced Simulation:** Building simulation, façade parametrics, and climate analysis were performed using **Autodesk Forma** and other tools (e.g., Twinmotion for rendering).

## 4. Technologies Used

* **BIM Platform:** Autodesk Revit Architecture & Revit Structure (Version: 2025) - Used for primary modeling and coordination.
* **Analysis/Design:** Autodesk Forma - Used for site analysis, built form mapping, climate analysis, and simulation.
* **Drafting:** Autodesk AutoCAD - Used for initial conceptual sketches and planning.
* **Visualization:** Twinmotion - Used for final rendering and walkthroughs.

## 5. Steps to Install and Run

The project delivery primarily consists of Revit project files (`.RVT`). **The reviewer must have Autodesk Revit 2025 installed.**

1.  **Software Installation (Prerequisite):** Ensure **Autodesk Revit 2025** is installed on a 64-bit Windows OS. The files are not backwards compatible.
2.  **Locate Project Files:** Extract the submission ZIP and navigate to the project directory: `Kanyaraasi01_25098/project/`.
3.  **Launch Revit 2025.**
4.  **Open the Files:** Click **File** > **Open** > **Project**. Select the main Revit Architecture model provided in the submission folder. The structural model is provided in the submission folders.
5.  *Public Link:* The public link to view the model and facade is also available here: `https://autode.sk/4ofki7n`.

## 6. Any Required Environment Variables

No specific environment variables are required to open and view the BIM files themselves, beyond a standard licensed installation of the required Autodesk software.

## 7. Screenshots or Sample Inputs (Optional)

Visual documentation is available within the submission folders, including:
* Final Renders and Walkthroughs.
* Presentation Drawings, Working Drawings, and Section/Elevations.
* Structural Reinforcement Drawings and Structure Model.
* The integrated workflow from site analysis to simulation is detailed here: .
* The overall aesthetic of the **HELIOSKIN HUB** is represented by the visual documentation .
